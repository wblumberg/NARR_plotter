# NARR_plotter
Scripts to make plots from NARR data.

This program makes some cookie-cutter maps from NARR data in order to give the user a decent idea of the weather that happened at some date/time within the NARR.

Some of the maps that can be created:

- 850, 700, 500, 300 mb
- surface data
- severe weather type maps.
